    "# Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this step, I prepared and preprocessed financial data for Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) covering fiscal years 2022–2024, extracted from their respective SEC 10-K filings. The objective was to transform raw financial data into a clean, structured, and AI-ready format suitable for an AI-powered financial chatbot. The process involved data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing, including feature engineering and time-series handling, to ensure the data was consistent, normalized, and enriched with relevant financial metrics. The input was a CSV file (`Financial_Data_MSFT_TSLA_AAPL_2022_2024.csv`) containing key financial metrics, and the output was a preprocessed CSV (`Preprocessed_Financial_Data_MSFT_TSLA_AAPL_2022_2024.csv`) with additional features for trend analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The input CSV file contained financial metrics for MSFT, TSLA, and AAPL, manually extracted from their 10-K filings for 2022–2024, as provided via SEC EDGAR links. The dataset included:\n",
    "- **Columns** (7 total):\n",
    "  - `Company`: Categorical (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla).\n",
    "  - `Year`: Integer (2022, 2023, 2024).\n",
    "  - Financial metrics (in millions of USD): `Total Revenue`, `Net Income`, `Total Assets`, `Total Liabilities`, `Cash Flow from Operating Activities`.\n",
    "- **Rows**: 9 (3 years × 3 companies).\n",
    "- **Example Data**:\n",
    "  - Apple 2022: Total Revenue = $394,328M, Net Income = $99,803M, Total Assets = $352,755M, Total Liabilities = $302,083M, Cash Flow = $122,151M.\n",
    "  - Tesla 2024: Total Revenue = $97,690M, Net Income = $7,091M, Total Assets = $123,936M, Total Liabilities = $49,876M, Cash Flow = $14,923M.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Cleaning\n",
    "I began by cleaning the input CSV to ensure data quality and consistency, critical for reliable AI-driven analysis. The cleaning steps included:\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: Checked for NaN or null values across all columns using pandas (`df.isnull().sum()`). No missing values were found, confirming the dataset’s completeness.\n",
    "- **Duplicates**: Verified for duplicate rows (`df.duplicated().sum()`). No duplicates existed, ensuring each company-year combination was unique.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: Ensured correct data types:\n",
    "  - `Company`: String (object).\n",
    "  - `Year`: Integer (`int64`).\n",
    "  - Financial metrics: Numeric (`int64` or `float64`). Converted financial columns to numeric using `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` to handle any potential formatting issues.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Confirmed all financial metrics were in millions of USD, as reported in the 10-K filings, with no unit conversions needed. Cross-referenced values with the original SEC filings to validate accuracy (e.g., Microsoft 2024 Total Revenue = $245,122M).\n",
    "- **Outcome**: The dataset was clean, with no missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies, ready for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Transformation\n",
    "I transformed the data to standardize and normalize it for AI model compatibility, ensuring comparability across companies with different financial scales (e.g., Apple’s ~$390B revenue vs. Tesla’s ~$100B). The transformation steps were:\n",
    "- **Unit Standardization**: Verified all financial metrics were in millions of USD, consistent with the 10-K filings, eliminating the need for unit conversions.\n",
    "- **Inflation Adjustment**: Considered adjusting for inflation but deemed it unnecessary for a three-year horizon (2022–2024), as nominal values were sufficient for the chatbot’s trend analysis and user queries. Inflation rates (e.g., ~3–6% annually per CPI) would have minimal impact.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Applied min-max scaling within each company to normalize financial metrics to a [0,1] range, facilitating AI model training across disparate scales. For each metric (e.g., Total Revenue), I calculated:\n",
    "  - `Normalized Value = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))`, grouped by Company.\n",
    "  - Example: Apple’s Total Revenue (min = $383,285M in 2023, max = $394,328M in 2022):\n",
    "    - 2022: (394,328 - 383,285) / (394,328 - 383,285) = 1.0.\n",
    "    - 2023: (383,285 - 383,285) / (394,328 - 383,285) = 0.0.\n",
    "    - 2024: (391,145 - 383,285) / (394,328 - 383,285) ≈ 0.7118.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Added normalized columns (e.g., `Total Revenue_Normalized`, `Net Income_Normalized`) to the dataset, ensuring AI models could process metrics consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Preprocessing for AI Models\n",
    "To prepare the data for AI-driven applications, I performed feature engineering, data encoding, and time-series handling to enhance the dataset’s utility for the chatbot. The preprocessing steps included:\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "  - **Financial Ratios**:\n",
    "    - **Profit Margin (%)**: Calculated as `(Net Income / Total Revenue) × 100`, rounded to 2 decimals, to measure profitability.\n",
    "      - Example: Apple 2022: (99,803 / 394,328) × 100 = 25.31%.\n",
    "      - Tesla 2024: (7,091 / 97,690) × 100 = 7.26%.\n",
    "    - **Leverage Ratio**: Calculated as `Total Liabilities / Total Assets`, rounded to 2 decimals, to assess financial risk.\n",
    "      - Example: Microsoft 2024: 243,112 / 512,163 = 0.47.\n",
    "      - Apple 2022: 302,083 / 352,755 = 0.86.\n",
    "  - **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rates**: Computed percentage changes for each financial metric to capture trends:\n",
    "    - `YoY_Growth (%) = ((Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year) × 100`, grouped by Company.\n",
    "    - Example: Apple 2023 Total Revenue: (383,285 - 394,328) / 394,328 × 100 ≈ -2.80%.\n",
    "    - Tesla 2024 Net Income: (7,091 - 14,997) / 14,997 × 100 ≈ -52.72%.\n",
    "    - For 2022 (no prior year), set growth rates to 0.\n",
    "  - **Lag Features**: Added previous year’s values for each metric to support time-series analysis:\n",
    "    - Example: Apple 2023 `Total Revenue_Lag1` = 394,328 (2022’s Total Revenue).\n",
    "    - Tesla 2024 `Net Income_Lag1` = 14,997 (2023’s Net Income).\n",
    "    - For 2022, set lag features to 0 (no prior data).\n",
    "- **Data Encoding**:\n",
    "  - Converted the categorical `Company` column into one-hot encoded columns (`Company_Apple`, `Company_Microsoft`, `Company_Tesla`) using pandas’ `get_dummies`.\n",
    "  - Example: Apple rows: `Company_Apple = 1`, `Company_Microsoft = 0`, `Company_Tesla = 0`.\n",
    "  - Output as boolean (`True/False`) for simplicity, convertible to `1/0` in later steps if needed.\n",
    "- **Time-Series Handling**:\n",
    "  - Sorted the data by `Company` and `Year` to ensure chronological order (e.g., Apple 2022–2024, Microsoft 2022–2024, Tesla 2022–2024).\n",
    "  - Handled NaN values in lag and YoY growth columns for 2022 (first year) by filling with 0, as no prior data existed.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: The dataset was enriched with 19 new columns:\n",
    "  - Normalized metrics (5): `Total Revenue_Normalized`, `Net Income_Normalized`, etc.\n",
    "  - Financial ratios (2): `Profit Margin (%)`, `Leverage Ratio`.\n",
    "  - Lag features (5): `Total Revenue_Lag1`, `Net Income_Lag1`, etc.\n",
    "  - YoY growth rates (5): `Total Revenue_YoY_Growth (%)`, `Net Income_YoY_Growth (%)`, etc.\n",
    "  - One-hot encoded (3): `Company_Apple`, `Company_Microsoft`, `Company_Tesla`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and Execution\n",
    "I used Python with the `pandas` library for data manipulation, executed in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or script). The key steps were:\n",
    "1. Loaded the input CSV using `pd.read_csv('Financial_Data_MSFT_TSLA_AAPL_2022_2024.csv')`.\n",
    "2. Performed cleaning checks (missing values, duplicates, data types).\n",
    "3. Applied transformations (normalization) using a custom min-max scaling function grouped by Company.\n",
    "4. Engineered features (ratios, YoY growth, lag features) using pandas’ `groupby`, `shift`, and `pct_change`.\n",
    "5. Encoded the `Company` column with `pd.get_dummies`.\n",
    "6. Sorted the data and filled NaN values with 0 using `df.fillna(0)`.\n",
    "7. Saved the preprocessed data to `Preprocessed_Financial_Data_MSFT_TSLA_AAPL_2022_2024.csv` using `df.to_csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "The resulting CSV (`Preprocessed_Financial_Data_MSFT_TSLA_AAPL_2022_2024.csv`) contained 26 columns and 9 rows:\n",
    "- **Original Columns** (7): `Year`, `Total Revenue`, `Net Income`, `Total Assets`, `Total Liabilities`, `Cash Flow from Operating Activities`, plus one-hot encoded `Company_Apple`, `Company_Microsoft`, `Company_Tesla` (replacing `Company`).\n",
    "- **New Columns** (19): Normalized metrics, financial ratios, lag features, and YoY growth rates.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Normalized metrics enabled cross-company comparisons for AI models.\n",
    "  - Profit Margin and Leverage Ratio provided financial health indicators.\n",
    "  - YoY growth and lag features supported trend analysis and forecasting.\n",
    "  - One-hot encoding made the data model-ready for categorical inputs.\n",
    "- **Example Row** (Apple 2024):\n",
    "  - `Year`: 2024, `Total Revenue`: 391,145, `Net Income`: 94,761, ..., `Total Revenue_Normalized`: 0.7118, `Profit Margin (%)`: 24.23, `Leverage Ratio`: 0.80, `Total Revenue_Lag1`: 383,285, `Total Revenue_YoY_Growth (%)`: 2.05, `Company_Apple`: True.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "I validated the output by:\n",
    "- **Cross-Checking**: Ensured original financial metrics matched the input CSV and 10-K filings.\n",
    "- **Calculations**: Verified normalization (e.g., Apple’s Total Revenue range), ratios (e.g., Tesla 2024 Profit Margin = 7.26%), and growth rates (e.g., Microsoft 2024 Revenue Growth = 15.67%).\n",
    "- **Integrity**: Confirmed no data loss, with all 9 rows preserved and new features correctly computed.\n",
    "- **AI Readiness**: Ensured the dataset was structured for machine learning, with normalized, encoded, and time-series features suitable for tasks like trend prediction or financial health scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "This preprocessing step transformed raw financial data into a robust, AI-ready dataset, critical for the chatbot’s ability to analyze trends, compare companies, and provide predictive insights. The added features (e.g., Profit Margin, YoY growth) enabled dynamic responses (e.g., “Tesla’s profitability dropped 52.7% in 2024”), while the time-series structure supported forecasting (e.g., using lag features for 2025 projections). The clean, enriched dataset laid the foundation for subsequent trend analysis and visualization in the Jupyter Notebook, ensuring the chatbot could deliver accurate, data-driven financial insights."

    "### Key Insights\n",
    "- **Microsoft**:\n",
    "  - **Performance**: Strong revenue growth (11.3% YoY average) and cash flow ($118.5B in 2024), driven by cloud (Azure) and AI (e.g., Copilot integration).\n",
    "  - **Chatbot Role**: Emphasize growth metrics (Total Revenue_YoY_Growth, Cash Flow_YoY_Growth) and high Profit Margin (~35%) to position Microsoft as a growth leader. Use lag features (e.g., Total Revenue_Lag1) for forecasting revenue trends.\n",
    "- **Apple**:\n",
    "  - **Performance**: Stable revenue (~$390B) and net income (~$95B), with a strong ecosystem (services revenue grew 46.5% gross margin per 10-K). Reduced liabilities (down 8.8% in 2024) enhance financial health.\n",
    "  - **Chatbot Role**: Highlight stability (low YoY growth variance) and Profit Margin (~25%) as indicators of reliability. Discuss services growth for long-term potential, using 10-K data for context.\n",
    "- **Tesla**:\n",
    "  - **Performance**: Volatile, with slowing revenue growth (0.95% in 2024) and a -52.7% net income drop ($7.1B in 2024) due to price cuts and EV competition. Energy storage (67% YoY growth per 10-K) offers upside.\n",
    "  - **Chatbot Role**: Focus on volatility (Net Income_YoY_Growth) and Leverage Ratio (~0.40) to assess risk. Highlight energy storage as a diversification driver to balance EV challenges.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**:\n",
    "  - **Profit Margin (%)** and **Leverage Ratio** are critical for assessing financial health, enabling the chatbot to compare companies (e.g., “Microsoft’s 35% margin vs. Tesla’s 7%”).\n",
    "  - **YoY Growth Rates** capture dynamic trends, supporting responses like “Microsoft’s revenue grew 15.7% in 2024, while Tesla’s grew 0.95%.”\n",
    "  - **Lag Features** (e.g., Net Income_Lag1) enable time-series forecasting, enhancing predictive capabilities.\n",
    "- **Time-Series Structure**: The sorted data and lag features support temporal queries (e.g., “How has Apple’s cash flow changed since 2022?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chatbot Design Recommendations\n",
    "- **Response Logic**: Implement conditional logic to tailor responses based on performance:\n",
    "  - Growth-oriented users: Recommend Microsoft (high YoY growth).\n",
    "  - Stability seekers: Suggest Apple (consistent metrics).\n",
    "  - Risk-tolerant users: Discuss Tesla’s potential in energy storage despite volatility.\n",
    "- **Visual Integration**: Embed saved plots (e.g., revenue_trend.png) in chatbot responses for visual queries (e.g., “Show Microsoft’s revenue trend”).\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: Use lag features and growth rates in a model (e.g., LSTM) to forecast metrics, enabling responses like “Microsoft’s 2025 revenue is projected to grow 10–12%.”\n",
    "- **Contextual Insights**: Incorporate 10-K context (e.g., Tesla’s competition, Apple’s supply chain issues in 2023) to explain trends, enhancing user trust."
